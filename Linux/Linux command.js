It seems like there might be a typo in your question ("Devoops" instead of "DevOps"). Assuming you're asking about the basics of using Linux commands in a DevOps context, I'll provide you with some fundamental commands that are commonly used. DevOps involves the integration of development and operations, and Linux is a widely used operating system in this context due to its flexibility and scripting capabilities.

1. **Navigation:**
    - `cd`: Change directory.
    - `pwd`: Print working directory.
    - `ls`: List files and directories.
    - `mkdir`: Create a new directory.
    - `rmdir` or `rm -r`: Remove an empty directory or a directory and its contents.

2. **File Operations:**
    - `touch`: Create an empty file.
    - `cp`: Copy files or directories.
    - `mv`: Move or rename files or directories.
    - `rm`: Remove files or directories.
    - `cat`: Concatenate and display the content of files.
    - `nano` or `vim`: Text editors to create or edit files.

3. **File Permissions:**
    - `chmod`: Change file permissions.
    - `chown`: Change file owner.
    - `chgrp`: Change file group.

4. **System Information:**
    - `uname`: Display system information.
    - `df`: Display disk space usage.
    - `free`: Display free and used memory.

5. **Process Management:**
    - `ps`: Display information about active processes.
    - `kill`: Terminate a process.
    - `top` or `htop`: Display real-time system statistics and active processes.

6. **Package Management (for systems using package managers like apt, yum, etc.):**
    - `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu): Package management tool.
    - `yum` (RHEL/CentOS): Package management tool.

7. **Network:**
    - `ifconfig` or `ip`: Display network interface information.
    - `ping`: Test network connectivity.
    - `netstat`: Display network connections, routing tables, and more.
    - `traceroute` or `mtr`: Trace the route that packets take to reach a destination.

8. **User Management:**
    - `adduser` or `useradd`: Add a new user.
    - `passwd`: Change user password.
    - `usermod`: Modify user properties.
    - `userdel` or `deluser`: Delete a user.

9. **Shell Scripting:**
    - Use a text editor like `nano` or `vim` to create shell scripts.
    - Make the script executable with `chmod +x script_name`.
    - Run the script with `./script_name`.

These commands provide a foundation for working with Linux systems in a DevOps environment. Depending on your specific tasks and the tools you use, you may need to explore additional commands and concepts.
