To download a file in Linux, you can use various command-line tools depending on your requirements. Here are a few commonly used methods:

1. **Using `wget`:**
   ```bash
   wget [URL]
   ```
   Replace `[URL]` with the actual URL of the file you want to download. For example:
   ```bash
   wget https://example.com/file.tar.gz
   ```

2. **Using `curl`:**
   ```bash
   curl -O [URL]
   ```
   Replace `[URL]` with the actual URL of the file. For example:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://example.com/file.tar.gz
   ```
   The `-O` option tells `curl` to save the file with the same name as in the URL.

3. **Using `scp` (Secure Copy, for remote servers):**
   ```bash
   scp [username@]host:source destination
   ```
   Replace `[username@]host:source` with the source file on a remote server and `destination` with the local path where you want to save the file. For example:
   ```bash
   scp user@example.com:/path/to/remote/file.txt /local/path
   ```

4. **Using `ftp` (File Transfer Protocol):**
   ```bash
   ftp [URL]
   ```
   Replace `[URL]` with the FTP server address. Once connected, you can use `get` to download a file.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ftp ftp.example.com
   ftp> get filename.txt
   ```

5. **Using `rsync`:**
   ```bash
   rsync -avP [source] [destination]
   ```
   Replace `[source]` with the source file or directory and `[destination]` with the local path where you want to save the file. For example:
   ```bash
   rsync -avP user@example.com:/path/to/remote/file.txt /local/path
   ```

Choose the method that best suits your needs and the available tools on your system. The `wget` and `curl` commands are often pre-installed on many Linux distributions and are suitable for downloading files from the web. If you're working with remote servers, `scp` and `rsync` are commonly used for secure file transfers.
