A **web server** and a **web framework** are both essential components of web development, but they serve different purposes and operate at different levels of the web application stack.

1. **Web Server**:

   - A web server is a software application or program that handles HTTP requests from clients (such as web browsers) and serves them with HTTP responses, typically by sending HTML pages or other web resources.
   - Its primary function is to deliver web content to clients upon request.
   - Examples of web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and LiteSpeed.

2. **Web Framework**:

   - A web framework is a collection of libraries, tools, and utilities designed to streamline the process of building web applications by providing pre-built components and abstractions for common tasks.
   - Web frameworks often include features such as URL routing, templating engines, database integration, form validation, and security mechanisms.
   - Developers use web frameworks to structure their code, handle HTTP requests and responses, manage application logic, and interact with databases.
   - Web frameworks typically run within a web server environment and rely on the web server to handle incoming HTTP requests and route them to the appropriate parts of the application.
   - Examples of web frameworks include Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Flask (Python), Express.js (Node.js), Laravel (PHP), and ASP.NET Core (C#).

In summary, a web server is responsible for serving web content to clients, while a web framework provides a structured approach and a set of tools for building web applications on top of a web server. The web framework typically sits on top of the web server, using its capabilities to handle incoming requests and deliver responses, while also providing additional functionality to streamline the development process.
